This is a script that collects emails and the authors for a GitHub repository that you give to the script.



## How does This Script work ?ðŸ“ƒ

1. You should give <strong>the GitHub repository links</strong> that you want to collect the authors' names and their emails to the script by writing the repository in the ``GitHub_links.txt`` file.

2. Run the script named ``Script.sh``, he will collect these emails for you.

3. Now, you can get your emails in the file named ``authors.txt``.
